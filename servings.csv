"*In 2000, the number of firms reporting vegetable oil production to the Census Bureau increased, and this contributed to the spike in the data for salad and cooking oils, shortening, and aggregated numbers that use these estimates, such as total vegetable fats & oils, total added fats & oils, and total calories from added fats & oils and from all foods.",,,,,,,,

"Note: Due to the termination of select Current Industrial Reports by the Census Bureau, data on durum flour cannot be updated beyond 2010, and thus white and whole wheat flour cannot be updated. The absence this data is not critical to the Food Availability Data System since data are still available at a higher level of aggregation (i.e., wheat flour). Annual data and per capita estimates for rice are unavailable beyond 2010 due to a large and unexplained decline in the implied total domestic and residual use estimate. Residual use accounts for all unreported losses in the milling, transporting, and marketing of rice, and also offsets any statistical error in another supply and use account. Due to the termination of select Current Industrial Reports (CIR) by the Census Bureau, data on some added fats and oils could not be updated beyond 2010 in the Food Availability Data System. This means that certain summary estimates—such as per capita daily amounts of calories and food pattern equivalents (or servings)—cannot be calculated beyond 2010 for the added fats & oils group. Additionally, the summary estimates or totals across all food groups cannot be calculated beyond 2010.",,,,,,,,
